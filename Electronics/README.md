A video is [here](https://www.facebook.com/61553801874212/videos/475630928153628/).

The VSR electronics consist of four PCBs:
- a Control Board
- a pushwheel controller, to which the pushwheels are attached
- two PCBs for the display: a controller and a "tube carrier".

The folders contain each
- Gerbers for production at eg. JLCPCB (.zip)
- BOMs for the PCB's (.csv)
- PickAndPlace (CPL) files for production
