The LED display consists of two PCBs stacked on each other.

1) The tube carrier: Gerber_TC-0.36-1.0; PCB_TC-0.36-1.0 (EasyEDA)
2) The i2c back pack: Gerber_I2CBP-0.36-1.0, BOM_I2CBP-0.36-1.0; PCB_I2CBP-0.36-1.0 (EasyEDA)

The connection between the PCBs can be using a pin header/socket (11 pins, 2mm pitch), or soldered using a pin header long enough to keep a distance between the PCBs.
